# Neural Style Transfer 
Neural Stlye is one attempt within deep learning to introduce art produced by Neural Networks. One style of this was introduced 
by Gatys et al in 2015 in the paper " A neural algorithm for artistic style", since then there has been a variety of attempts of introducing this style into other domains like photos, and designs. One other paradigm which came out farely recently was by helena sarin who introduced art by the use of GANs. Because of our interest in the intersection of art and Deep Learning, we learn and blog about neural art in our free time. We hope to start at the original paper and make our way through the confluence of papers which have been published since 2015. We ultimately plan to reach the recent papers and approaches to neural art. 

Given below would be a small roadmap :

  1. [Theory of Neural Style Transfer](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-style-transfer-tutorial-part-1-f5cd3315fa7f)
 
  2. [Implementation of Neural Style Transfer](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-style-transfer-series-part-2-91baad306b24)

  3. Additional Tweaks of the original paper like [preserving color](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05897) and a few improvements on the original paper.
  
  4. Masked Style Transfer
  
  5. Multiple Style Transfer.
  
  6. Texture Style Transfer 
  
  7. Fast Neural Style Transfer
  
  8. Neural Style Transfer for Facial Portraits, Images.
  
  9. Neural Doodle
  
  10. Video Style Transfer
  
  11. Character Style Transfer 
  
  12. GAN style generation of art.
  
  
  
TODO : Adding Links of the Papers to be read
